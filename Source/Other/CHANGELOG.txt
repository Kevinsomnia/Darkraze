[PRE-ALPHA] v.0.5.4a (Update #6)
MAJOR UPDATE [92 changes were made since last update]
ADD: Ragdoll prefab, and instantiation on player death for the local player.
ADD: Created an automatic boundary system. If you are outside of the boundary (falling off the map), you will die instantly.
ADD: New game mode: Free For All (Deathmatch). Every player you see besides yourself is an enemy. Reach the kill limit to win.
ADD: Started to work on networked bot AI with pathfinding. This will fill up the slots to the player limit, and will be automatically replaced by a real player if there are no more slots left. You may change the amount and their preferences in the server settings. Able to participate in teams and multiple game modes and kill players and bots alike. They have simulated field of view and line of sight detection. Additionally, they will try to maintain recoil and spread, just like real players would.
ADD: Animations to the player's shadow, not very fluid but the shadow is placeholder anyway, and shadows aren't entirely important as of now.
ADD: Slight screen shake on ground impact.
ADD: Kill assists. EXP distribution is based upon proportions, except for the killer.
ADD: New voxel engine which is very similar to Minecraft. This will introduce some maps with destructible environments.
ADD: New scope attachment (prototype-ish), name is undecided. It outlines enemies and other environment edges to make things more visible either in the night or daylight. One flaw is that you cannot distinguish enemies from allies, and it may not outline targets effectively due to camouflage or detection error.
ADD: 3 new placeholder weapons (RPK, MP5-SD, and MP-412 REX), just to add a variety of weapons for upcoming alpha builds. This introduces new 'base' weapons for LMGs, SMGs and revolvers.
ADD: Basic quick match functionality, which randomly selects a server from the server list. This will be improved in the future, but it works for now.
ADD: Leveling system implemented. You will accumulate experience at the end of every round/match, and will level up accordingly.

MOD: EMP now makes hit direction indicator less accurate.
MOD: Added sorting to the server list. Sort by name, player count, game mode, etc...
MOD: Improved anti-clip detection and smoothing.
MOD: Added waiting for players text for the leaderboard.
MOD: Muzzle flash now uses Alpha Blended shader instead of Additive shader to avoid overpowered brightness.
MOD: Developer console now has auto-completion. You no longer have to type the entire string out to execute that command.
MOD: Join button is disabled and a tool-tip will pop out when the server is full.
MOD: Sprinting then jumping will allow you to fire your weapon once again.
MOD: Your sprinting speed will gradually slow down when stamina is depleting.
MOD: Improved accuracy of crouch detection.
MOD: Drastically improved player physics. You affect rigidbodies on impact (momentum transfer), and your weight now shifts the center of mass.
MOD: You are now able to cook grenades when quick throwing (by holding G or the quick throw grenade key).
MOD: Increased reliability of listing players and bots in the leaderboard.
MOD: Increased crosshair opacity and slightly improved texture.
MOD: Bonus actions such as kill assists or headshots will be displayed in a smaller font size.
MOD: You can now quickly cycle between grenade types by pressing "4" key multiple times. It will also give an notification of what is currently selected.
MOD: Improved/added new sprites to the GUI atlas to improve visuals.
MOD: Improved visual FX such as explosions from grenades.
MOD: Major upgrade to the UI system, you can now highlight portions of text inside input fields, and support for advanced effects such as gradients.
MOD: Recoil now has an influence pattern. This makes the recoil more predictable and more controllable. Also gives some weapons a distinct feel.
MOD: Redesigned the scoreboard/leaderboard UI completely.
MOD: Adjusted the pistol sprinting animation to lower the gun rather than raise it. It makes the animation more believable, and it's less distracting.
MOD: Increased the kill limit range to 25 - 500 (previously 10 - 250).
MOD: The spawn screen spectator cameras will now randomly cycle if it's idle.
MOD: Draw animation now plays on spawn to match with the remote players.
MOD: Made the news feed more bigger, since it was displaying too little content at a time.
MOD: Reduced workload and bandwidth on send-to-self server messages/RPCs, since it is unnecessary to call these functions over the network if the source and destination are the same.
MOD: Additional recoil will be added if firing the weapon for a extended duration of time. This should make it more essential to burst-fire at longer ranges.
MOD: Increased movement acceleration and sprinting acceleration since it felt too sluggish.
MOD: Improved pistol fire animations greatly, and extended the system with a variety of special parameters.
MOD: Improved audio effects of the heartbeat and static sounds.
MOD: Name tags will not display when the teammate is far away or not near the center of the screen to reduce UI clutter. Additionally, they will not display through zoomed scopes since render textures are not accounted for.
MOD: Improved and updated breathing sound. As your stamina decreases, your breath rate and volume will increase, not just the volume.
MOD: Footsteps will now avoid repeating the last played footstep, if possible. Additionally, the concrete footsteps have been improved slightly.
MOD: Generally increased the muzzle velocity of all weapons slightly.
MOD: Hit direction indicators will now ignore further indicators if all are from the same origin in a very short time period. Especially noticeable when hit by guns that shoot multiple bullets.
MOD: Kill feed will now display the weapon name that the victim was killed by.
MOD: Drawing animation now affects the camera.
MOD: You cannot shoot your weapon while transitioning to aiming (sorry MLG quickscopers).
MOD: Rewritten the login and registration system. This also means that you can finally login to the game, with your data stored online!
MOD: Many UI elements and visuals have been adjusted to be more visible on darker monitors (this was a common complaint).
MOD: Made bots more distinguishable in the lobby or the scoreboard, by making their clan tag use (parentheses) rather than [square brackets], and made the tint a different shade.
MOD: The honeycomb shield texture will glow an orange color when the shields are damaged, and when recharging shields, it will glow blue. Also, it should be more noticeable since the opacity was too low.
MOD: Modified the bullet tracer slightly, it now has a very slight variation in the texture, rather than it being a straight line, and it now tiles correctly.
MOD: Improved the aiming animation to follow a curved movement pattern rather than linear.
MOD: Created new weapon icons for all the weapons.
MOD: Made EMP effect more effective by making the screen tear (intentionally) to act like the helmet is malfunctioning. This also makes it considerably harder to aim. Additionally, hearing will be impaired (low pass filter).
MOD: Explosions will effect the camera using a new technique: radial blur and fish-eye distortion, and will impair hearing as well (low pass filter).
MOD: Improved blood splatter particle texture and effects.
MOD: Rounded the hit indicator rotation to the nearest 30th degree, so you can't pinpoint the exact location of where you're being hit from (general direction).
MOD: Once again, many first person animations were improved in general.

FIX: Highlighting system on the server list buttons now colors itself correctly.
FIX: Fixed a minor bug in the grenade interpolation code.
FIX: Fixed equipping the same weapon for primary and secondary would give you extra (separate) reserve ammo. Now it's being "shared" since they're using the same magazines.
FIX: Carat display is now handled properly when the input component is disabled.
FIX: Spectator camera will now start at the correct position, not from Vector3.zero.
FIX: You will now automatically un-crouch (crouching caused some weird bug) when latching onto a ladder.
FIX: Pressing space-bar while crouched under an object will make you stand up ignoring collision.
FIX: Fixed a minor bug where the spectator camera will switch constantly when new player instances spawn.
FIX: A few rigidbody-player collision bugs. Also platform check accuracy is improved.
FIX: Bullet hole scale corrected after being pooled.
FIX: Fixed many animation bugs dealing with quick throwing. The grenade type will properly switch when it runs out and quick throwing with grenades equipped is no longer possible.
FIX: Teammate markers will now correctly destroy upon death.
FIX: Minor bug that makes spectator camera poke through colliders and objects for a frame.
FIX: Temporary reloading animation not playing with shotguns (or other singular reload weapons).
FIX: Chromatic aberration shader not doing anything.
FIX: Sun shafts auto-detecting the shaft source is now working properly.
FIX: Assists and kill bonuses are now rewarded even when the player is dead (previously, you had to be alive to receive the assist bonus).
FIX: Kill parsing is now more reliable, supports bot suicides, and uses a little bit less bandwidth.
FIX: The distortion image effect's UV offset was not working properly.
FIX: Cone of dispersion for weapons was incorrect when looking up vertically. This is now fixed.
FIX: Being able to chat to a 'team' in Deathmatch or non-team based game modes.
FIX: Muzzle smoke is now simulated in world space rather than local. It should also hide the ugly edges of the bullet smoke trail.
FIX: After the EMP phase is complete, the weapon icon should no longer disappear. This is due to the UI system upgrade, but is now fixed.
FIX: Interpolation for the trail controller to make it emit more consistently. Now rocket trails should display correctly even when in low frame-rates.
FIX: Major rendering bug which would glitch out the UI and game view when using Deferred Rendering.

DEL: Removed fake ambient occlusion underneath the player's feet, since they were causing artifacts.
DEL: Removed the old shotgun model (EZR-29). Didn't look clean and was not futuristic anyway.
DEL: Removed 'quit to desktop' from the in-game pause menu to prevent any networking problems and other gameplay issues. Now you must quit to the main menu before you can close the game.
DEL: Removed hit markers, but a distinctive sound will still play to signal that you successfully damaged the target. 

======================================================================

ADD: Custom mouse cursor to give a better feel than the default cursor.
ADD: Can no longer exit the game with ALT-F4; force quitting will cause more problems than it will to solve.
ADD: Shuffling equipment sound effect when moving, including running, sprinting, jumping, crouching, aiming, and much more. Louder when sprinting (main purpose of why I added it). Synced across the network.
ADD: Sharp blur of vision when being damaged, will quickly subside. Intensity correlates with damage.
ADD: Accounts are now added. You can login and save your stats. Registration is through a website.
ADD: Idle swaying will increase when you are exhausted (low in stamina).
ADD: When low on health, your HUD will start to flicker and distort.
ADD: Added a new melee system (WIP) with a new weapon (plasma knife, thanks to Beanster).
ADD: Shooting will slow down movement very slightly due to recoil and concentration (7.5% slower).
ADD: Player cannot shoot within 0.5 seconds of his spawn time in case of accidental fire.
ADD: Created a new custom object/particle pooling system for performance. Allows to save GC Allocations and overall CPU usage when instantiating.

ADD: Game modes have different conditions that must be met to count as a victory. Can be changed when creating a server.
ADD: User is now able to send bug reports or feedback to developers.
ADD: Added a new launcher weapon using extended gun controller which now supports projectiles (rockets, grenades, etc).
ADD: Rocket system with 'flight randomness' and gravity.
ADD: Some weapons, such as rocket launchers, are capable of reloading on weapon click. Mainly to avoid producing a "dry fire" sound, and it's more sensible to have it this way.
ADD: Server availability system. First checks for web response (for internet connection and server failure), then uses ping for response time.
ADD: Background distorted noise when low on health, also matches well with the image effects.
ADD: Bullet fly-by sound effects to give presence of bullets more noticeable.
ADD: Decal system to greatly improve detail of scene.
ADD: A new particle trail controller system, to overcome certain problems with the particles.

ADD: Ping limit for servers, auto-kicks if greater than the threshold for at least 5 consecutive seconds.
ADD: Hit indicator to tell which direction you took damage from.
ADD: An assignable (server setting) idle timer which automatically kicks inactive players.
ADD: Quick throwing grenade using G. Effective if you want to throw one grenade.

MOD: Improved dynamic gun movement.
MOD: Smoothed out the bobbing animation and improved it.
MOD: Made the recoil animation smoother, responsive, and natural. Also added slight horizontal and vertical kick. (all movement done with coding)
MOD: MANY MAJOR optimizations in the scripts! (240-325 FPS on Intel i5 (scripts only), previously 150-210 FPS).
MOD: Optimizations in the networking framework and new compression methods.
MOD: Rewrote the Weapon Manager script to instantiate the weapons in inventory automatically. Pressing 0 will switch to hands.
MOD: Corrected fire rate to be consistent regardless of frame-rate.
MOD: Aiming now has a anti-spam system so it won't look "jerky" or "glitchy".
MOD: Optimized and improved detail of bullet "hit particles".

MOD: You can now switch weapons even when in mid-air.
MOD: Made the mouse look script much more responsive and optimized.
MOD: Stamina recharge rate is now dependent on the movement speed. Standing still will make your stamina recharge the fastest.
MOD: Rewritten "use object" system, it's a lot smarter and causes less problems than before
MOD: Fall damage now slows down movement speed temporarily. It also has a limping animation for the camera.
MOD: Made the death ragdoll much more realistic and random. It also inherits the velocity of their movement. Previously, it looked VERY static and unrealistic every time it died.

MOD: You can now sprint diagonally for maneuverability, but at a slower rate.
MOD: Camera upward kick and GUI shake creates a more immersive environment to the player.
MOD: Dynamic movement now depends on the rotation velocity rather than the input.
MOD: Aiming now slows the player down slightly, depending on how heavy the weapon is (for example: aiming with pistols won't affect as much as assault rifles).

MOD: Anti-clip system is much smoother, and includes positional updates as well.
MOD: Health regeneration dramatically slows down as you recuperate health.
MOD: Many adjustments to weapon accuracy and other factors.
MOD: Jumping adds a slight force to the current perpendicular slope.
MOD: Running up steeper slopes will drain a extra stamina and slightly reduce recovery rate.
MOD: Movement speed will be slightly reduced during an impact (from any height).
MOD: Changing the time-scale of the game will also change the physics update interval (time-step). This causes rigidbodies to appear smoother during "slow-motion".
MOD: Pressing space-bar (or jump key) while crouching will make you stand up.
MOD: Allowed editing of server settings while in lobby (for host only).
MOD: Crouch detection to see if there is anything above player before standing up.
MOD: Acceleration and deceleration of speed when toggling sprint.
MOD: Now using Update instead of FixedUpdate to fire the weapon to save on performance. This also means that fire rate will no longer be consistent when at extremely low frame rates.
MOD: Rewritten the player movement script from scratch, now the movement appears much smoother and has less collision glitches.
MOD: Getting hurt will temporarily reduce stamina regeneration.
MOD: Now weapon accuracy selects random point within a circle, instead of a square. This will lead to a more natural "cone of fire".
MOD: Aim mouse sensitivity now decreases accordingly to the scope (if there is one) magnification.
MOD: Added fake and subtle ambient occlusion near the feet.
MOD: New glowing effect added to tracers and muzzle flash.
MOD: Aiming shifts the weapon position instead of the camera position.
MOD: Revised image effect values to have a balance between visual quality and playability.
MOD: Added many animation curves to improve coded animations drastically, looking more fluid and professional than ever.
MOD: Sprint rotation will snap more quickly to the aim position/rotation when aiming.

MOD: Default vertical FOV is now 65. The weapon position will change according to the FOV to reduce distortion.
MOD: You can no longer chat without at least one valid character in the input.
MOD: Bullets now have a damage falloff depending on the weapon, allowing for certain weapons to have different effective ranges.
MOD: Bullet holes now glow for a while on impact, making the burn marks more plausible.
MOD: Reduced the connection timeout in multiplayer.
MOD: Drastically improved handling of closing servers on the master server.

FIX: Restrictions now update every frame rather than button click, this fixes the glitch with weapons not firing.
FIX: Decomposing shader now works properly!
FIX: Training map glitches and errors.
FIX: Turret AI now detects player and will fire once in sight.
FIX: Grenades (and other rigidbodies) will not go through objects at fast speeds.

FIX: Footsteps now change correctly and accurately.
FIX: Glitches with the switching weapon animation.
FIX: Semi-auto weapons will not miss input anymore (queued fire).
FIX: Sliding sometimes doesn't work (due to raycast), so it has a secondary check.
FIX: Hitting your head (via jumping), will cause you to stop floating.
FIX: Pausing game now actually pauses/stops the audio (only in single-player).
FIX: You cannot switch weapons while reloading, otherwise the sound would glitch and not play.
FIX: Fixed some glitches inside the switching animations.
FIX: Some bugs and glitches with picking up weapons.
FIX: A dynamic movement gun problem when facing very low time-scale values.
FIX: The bloody GUI screen will now desaturate properly according to health.

FIX: Muzzle light now fades and renders correctly (previously rendered for one frame).
FIX: Work-around for issues with GUI depth (mostly within chatboxes).
FIX: Disconnection of server now properly closes the instance within the master server.

EDITOR: Added a weapon icon generator that speeds up the process by a lot and is only a few simple clicks to generate. You still have to use Photoshop to invert the color (to white) and add a glow effect.
EDITOR: Added a weapon ID controller to show which ID's are which and also assigning ID's.
EDITOR: Added a grenade ID controller to show which ID's are which and also assigning ID's.
EDITOR: Improved inspector GUI for organization and workflow.

DEL: Shop system
DEL: ACR since it is replaced with NR-94.
DEL: Bullet penetration.
